            <p>The books are listed in no particular order, or rather, in the order I remembered them while writing
                this. I read all
                sort of books and this hopefully this list reflects just that. If you're on Goodreads, you can checkout

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Project Hail Mary</strong> by Andy Weir. One of my favorite science fictions of all time.
                        They're
                        even making a movie out of it! Throughouly enjoyable and has lots of cool science. A total page
                        turner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Metamorphosis</strong> by Franz Kafka. A masterpiece. Amazing how relatable it was
                        despite being a
                        rather strange work of fiction.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>White Nights</strong> by Fyodor Dostoevsky. A rather poetic novella about solitude. Good
                        read.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>1984</strong> by George Orwell. A classic. Only recently got the time to read it. Thought
                        provoking.
                        The author was born in Bihar btw.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Design as Art</strong> by Bruno Murari. Has some nice illustrations. Talks about why
                        design should be
                        both functional and beautiful. Oddball book I picked up because I thought I was good at
                        sketching. I am not.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Infinite Powers</strong> by Steven Strogatz. Talks about the history of Calculus. Lots of
                        fun maths
                        history trivia. Has an image of Newton's notebook where he discovers integrals for the first
                        time!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Revolutionaries</strong> by Sanjeev Sanyal. Talks about the rebel movements &amp;
                        revolutionaries of
                        pre-independent India. I'm a history nerd so I really liked this one.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>The Incredible History of India's Geography</strong> by Sanjeeev Sanyal. Enjoyed this one
                        thorughly.
                        Good gift material for kids too.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Let's Talk Money</strong> by Monika Halan. Personal finance stuff. Very well written.
                        Covers a lot of
                        ground.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Cosmos</strong> by Carl Sagan. Magnum opus of Carl Sagan. Inspiring &amp; revealing. A
                        must read.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Animal Farm</strong> by George Orwell. Throughouly enjoyed this one. Very reflective of
                        the human society. It's fascinating how well Orwell manages to describe the world around you in
                        absurd and
                        wildly imaginary setttings.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cool books I own but haven't read yet</h3>
