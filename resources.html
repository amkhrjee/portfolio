            <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
            <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <p>I highly recommend learning JS from <a href="https://javascript.info/">javascript.info</a>. It's like the
                missing
                documentation to the language. The <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">official
                    documentaion</a> is good
                enough for getting started with Typescript.</p>
            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html">official
                    tutorial</a> is good
                enough. <em>Head First
                    Python</em> is good too. Just write a lot of code.</p>
            <h3>C &amp; C++</h3>
            <p>Although learning C is not a prerequisite to learning C++, I recommened you learn C first anyway. The
                folllowing are
                excellent books for getting started with C.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>The C Programming Language</em> by K&amp;R</li>
                <li><em>Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C Programming</em> by Robert Seacord</li>
                <li><em>Expert C Programming: Deep Secrets</em> by Peter van der Linden</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For C++, <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/">learncpp.com</a> provides excellent tutorials.</p>
            <h3>Rust</h3>
            <p>I learnt Rust (and still learn, when needed) from <a href="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/">Brown
                    University's
                    fork</a> of the official Rust book. I also encourage you to checkout <a
                    href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhLlO5Vugx6KCwTpW_4fUeES2jdkDSW9&amp;si=6ZjA9GpD9rijoDOOi">this
                    youtube playlist</a> by the channel <em>300 seconds of Rust</em>.</p>
            <p> <a
                    href="https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/error-handling.html">This</a>
                is a excellent article on error handling in Rust.</p>
            <h3>Go</h3>
            <p>I love Go. I learnt Go from <a href="https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1">A Tour of
                    Go</a>. I refer to <a href="https://gobyexample.com/">Go by Examples</a>
                whenever necessary.
            </p>
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p><em>Head First Java</em> is a good introduction to the language. Perhaps you'll also need to go
                through <em>Head
                    First Design Patterns</em>, which uses Java.</p>
            <h3>x86 Assembly</h3>
            <p>I had picked up <em>Assembly Language for x86 Processors</em> by Kip R. Irvine from my university library
                in 2022 and
                I think it taught me quite a bit of assembly in a weekend.</p>
            <h2>Computer Architecture</h2>
            <p>I think these two books work as excellent introduction to the subject:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Computer Organization &amp; Architecture</em> by William Stallings</li>
                <li><em>Computer Architecture: A Quantitive Approach</em> by Hennessy &amp; Patterson</li>
            </ul>
            <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OnurMutluLectures">Prof. Onur Mutlu's
                    YouTube
                    channel</a> is a treaure
                trove of
                extremely good CompArch lectures, including the cutting-edge stuff.</p>
            <h2>Memory Managenent</h2>
            <p>Read the paper <a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf">What Every
                    Programmer Should
                    Know About Memory</a> by U. Drepper.</p>
            <p>I've found this <a
                    href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiwt1iVUib9s2Uo5BeYmwkDFUh70fJPxX&amp;si=1296I6Su6qnl2lLe">Youtube
                    Lecture Series by Prof. Black-Schaffer</a> to be extremely helpful for learning how virtual memory
                works.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjgw_ONy8oIDjV3r0bOawg6dECNQuEqiA&amp;si=tEpHPuTAIsuw5nJw">These
                    videos</a> by David Tarnoff are great for learning about cache memory and data alignment.</p>
            <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
            <p>My personal favourite is the book Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz, Gagne &amp; Galvin.</p>
            <p>I've heard good things about the <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">Operating System:
                    Three Easy
                    Pieces</a> book too.</p>
            <p>I also finished the <a href="https://os.husseinnasser.com/">Fundamentals of
                    Operating Systems</a> course
                by Huussein
                Nasser and would definitely recommend it.</p>
            <h2>Compilers</h2>
            <p>Although <a href="https://www-2.dc.uba.ar/staff/becher/dragon.pdf">the dragon
                    book</a> is the standard
                when it comes
                to compiler design, I'd recommend against jumping on it first.</p>
            <p>Instead, pick up <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting
                    Interpreters</a> by Robert Nystrom
                to get a
                first-hand experience of how interpreters are built in the real world. You can look into <a
                    href="https://interpreterbook.com/">Writing an Interpreter in Go</a> or <a
                    href="https://compilerbook.com/">Writing a Compiler in Go</a> too. Both
                are
                written by Throsten
                Ball.</p>
            <h2>Databases</h2>
            <p>I got my introduction to databases from the standard text <em>Fundamentals of Database Systems</em> by
                Elmasri
                &amp; Navathe.
                It provides a good mathematical grounding for further, more practical explorations into the field.</p>
            <p>Brian Holt has nice courses on <a
                    href="https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-databases/">databases</a> &amp; <a
                    href="https://sql.holt.courses/">SQL</a>.</p>
            <p>Hussein Nasser's course <a
                    href="https://www.udemy.com/share/102qyG3@Fvnc6x7tlacTisw21juVcPzvxNmll_azBs6uHO9PRaM-Ym3U8lSmAp43x1ZEPNHdvA==/">Fundamentals
                    of Database Engineering</a> is more than excellent for getting your feet wet into the nitty-gritties
                of the
                field.</p>
            <h2>Discrete Mathematics</h2>
            <p><em>Discrete Mathematics &amp; Its Application</em> by Kenneth Rosen probably has everything you'll ever
                need. I
                actually read <em>Essentials of Discrete Mathematics</em> by David Hunter and found it more accessible
                than the
                Rosen book.</p>
            <h2 id="calculus">Calculus</h2>
            <p>A working understanding of Calculus is essential for machine learning.
                I'd highly recommend going through <em>Calculus: Concepts & Contexts</em> by Stewart & Kokoska. It
                covers vector calculus along with all the necessary prerequisites.</p>
            <p>Grant Sanderson's <a
                    href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-GT3co4r2wlh6UHTUeQsrf3mlS2lk6x&amp;si=zrOjWLl0kob4m0oD">
                    <em>Essence
                        of Calculus</em></a> playlist is a must-watch.</p> His Khan Academy course on <a
                href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus">multivariable
                calculus</a> is extremely good as well.
            <h2>Linear Algebra</h2>
            <p>Some say ML is just glorified Linear Algebra. Just like thousands others, I also got started
                with <em>Introduction to Linear Algebra</em> by Gilbert Strang. You can also read the <a
                    href="https://nostarch.com/linearalgebra">Manga Guide to Linear
                    Algebra</a>
                if you're a weeb.</p>
            <p>Grant Sanderson's <a
                    href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&amp;si=qjnue7M0er4lEWx9">Linear
                    Algebra</a> playlist is a must-watch. You can also watch <a
                    href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">Gilbert Strang's MIT
                    lectures</a> (and can
                download them using my tool <a href="https://github.com/amkhrjee/ocwd">ocwd</a>s).</p>
            <h2 id="probability">Probability &amp; Statistics</h2>
            <p> <a href="https://probability4datascience.com/">Introduction to Probability
                    for
                    Data Science</a> by
                Stanley Chan is
                the single best book I've ever read on the subject.
            <p>

                I read <em>Head First Statistics</em> and I think it provides a good overview of the subject.</p>
            </p>
            <p>I also read Statistics for People Who Think They Hate Statistics in R while taking a <a
                    href="https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc21_cs23/preview">Data
                    Science
                    course</a> from IIT Madras.
            </p>
            <h2>Developer Tools &amp; Utilities</h2>
            <p>ThePrimeagen's <a href="https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-git">Everything
                    You'll Need to Know About
                    Git</a> is a
                pretty good Git tutorial. If you're looking for more advanced stuff, you should probably head to <a
                    href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">learngitbranching</a>.</p>
            <p>Brian Holt's <a href="https://containers-v2.holt.courses/">Complete Intro
                    to
                    Containers v2</a> is a great
                place to
                start learning about containers &amp; Docker.</p>
            <h2>AWS Certifications</h2>
            <p>I got my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification (yeah, that's a mouthful) by bingeing <a
                    href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-c">Neal
                    Davis's
                    Udemy
                    course</a> in 6 days. He's really good at explaining stuff.</p>
            <p>I also made my notes <a
                    href="https://satisfying-wallet-4a1.notion.site/AWS-Certs-Prep-f608a6f62fe04059bbf739f2b238bbb0">public</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
            <p>I'm still in the process of teaching myself DL. These were the steps I took and I think are good
                enough
                to get a good understanding of the fundamentals of the subject. I assume you know the basics of <a
                    href="#probability">Probability & Stats</a> and <a href="#calculus">Calculus</a>.</p>
